        <h1>All About Blogging</h1>
        <p> Blogging is a collection of skills that one needs to run and supervise a blog. 
            This entails equipping a web page with tools to make the process of writing,
             posting, linking, and sharing content easier on the internet.
             It’s important to mention that the popularity of blogging grows with each 
             passing day! To answer the question ‘what is blogging’, we need to look at
              the factors behind its rise. In the early stages, blogs became mainstream, as news services began using them as tools
            for outreach and opinion forming. They became a new source of information.When you are passionate about something, you want to share it with the world. Whether it’s a passion 
            for fishing, photography, or marketing, blogging is an excellent way to share that passion. When you 
            blog about something you are passionate about, 
            it opens the door to connecting with those around the world who speak your language 
            and have the same passions</p>
